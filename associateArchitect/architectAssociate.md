## IAM & AWS CLI

- Cloud Overview
    - AWS Regions: Cluster of data centers. us-east-1, eu-west-3
    - Availability zones: each region has many availabilty zones. One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networdking and connectivity. They are seperate from each other, so they are isolated from disasters. They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking. For example: us-east-1a
    - factors for choosing aws regions: government requirements, proximity to customers, available services within a region, pricing
- IAM: identity access management. It is a global service
    - root account created by default, shouldnt be used or shared
    - users are people within your organization, and can be grouped. Usres dont have to be in groups, but can be in multiple groups. They can also have inline policies
        - users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
        - least privilidge principle: dont give more permissions than a user needs
    - IAM Policices Structure
        - consists of version number, id, statement
        - statments consists of sid, effect (allow or deny service), principal(which account it is applied to), action(api calls allowed), resource(list of resources applied to), condition(optional. conditions when statment is applied)
    - Protect IAM Accounts
        - Password policy
        - Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
    - How users can access AWS
        - options
            - AWS Management console (protected by password + MFA)
            - AWS CLI: protected by access key
            - AWS SDK: for code protected by access keys
        - access keys generated by AWS console. users manage their own access keys
        - access key is username. Secret access key is password
    - **Cloudshell**: browser based shell. Available top right side of nav bar. Not available in all regions
        - All files created in cloudshell exists even after shell restarted
    - IAM Roles: some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf. To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services IAM Roles
        - Common roles: EC2 instance roles, lambda function roles, roles for cloudformation
    - IAM Security Tools
        - IAM Credentials Report (account-level): a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
        - IAM Access Advisor (user-level): access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed. You can use this information to revise your policies
